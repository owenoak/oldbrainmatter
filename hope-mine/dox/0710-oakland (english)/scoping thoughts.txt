Scoping thoughts

	- basic hierarchy:
			site
				app
					page
						panel/grouper
							control

define your app as a series of these files:
	sitename.hope, appname.hope, etc.
	
	FILE sitename.hope:
		<site id='sitename'>				<-- id is implicitly tied to file name if not specified
			<app id='email' src='email.hope' load="start" />
			<app id='calendar' src='calendar.hope' load="background" />
			<app id='' src=''/>
		</site>


* Implicit login and user semantics?

* make heavy use of nesting IDs, so we can have both
		"#contacts #listView"  and 	"#email #listView"
	without getting confused
	-- key for components...  problem with dojo.query? css()
	-- english:  [the] listView of contacts  ?  explicit id match?

* scoping ala message passing heirarchy?
* event manager and "when what message", eg
		when panel2 loads
			...
		when
		
	- that sets up an observation mechanism on #panel2's "load" mechanism
	- panel2 may not be loaded now
	- should automatically hook up when panel2 is brought into scope
	- pass/kill event semantics?
