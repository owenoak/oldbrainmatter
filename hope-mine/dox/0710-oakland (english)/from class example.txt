Notes from class example:

 * Need easy way to set base directories
 	- <base/> ?
 	- for:  standard libraries/classes, themes
 * How/when to get class parser auto-loading?
 * How/when to get template expander to work?
 	
 * Need compact way to say "load a bunch of files"
		<script src='../../scripts/hope.js'></script>
		<script src='../../scripts/Template.js'></script>
		<script src='../../scripts/hope.js'></script>
		<script src='../../scripts/ClassParser.js'></script>
		<script src='../../scripts/SmartJS.js'></script>
		<script src='../../scripts/Control.js'></script>
		<class src='../../scripts/controls.classes'></class>
	- "standard" hope libs?

* arrays -- ADD TO ARRAY?
	- shuffle()
	- next()
	- remove()

* need to do reverse case sensitive map for <property>s
* parsing in page -- how to get around FF not doing unary tags properly?
* want to be able to add script directly to an object when creating it
* wierd nesting issues with <cardgame><table><pile></></></>
* need better debugging when functons are being initialized
	-- catch exceptions when setting script and show lines around problem area
* child initializing: 
	- defered child init is nice, but it seems wierd to set things up after draw()
* templates are not inheriting (think CardPile and CardStockPile)

* really want a debugging control panel
	- turn on/off debugging/timing for things in a cookie
* 


CARD SPECIFIC STUFF:
 * how to do cardOffset with CSS only?
