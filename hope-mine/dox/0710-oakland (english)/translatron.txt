Translatron

	* figure out langauge user wants to see (from navigator.language)
	* figure out the language the page was sent as (part of script? from headers?)
	* figure out translation service (use meta-tag in browser)

1) In a web page, when you have something to be translated, stick a "translate" class on it:
		...<td class='translate'>This text should be translated</td>
2) A tiny JS engine which:
	1) grabs all of the 'translate' elements and puts them in a hash
	2) hits a web service with the hash, 
		server translates each of the values and returns a translated hash
	3) all translate elements get updated live in the page with the translated hash


The real benefit comes from the service cross different applications.
Using auto-translate services initially (with low priority)
	which then get replaced with human-entered translations


Have an easy way for folks to contribute known translation bundles to bootstrap database
	(from opensource projects)
