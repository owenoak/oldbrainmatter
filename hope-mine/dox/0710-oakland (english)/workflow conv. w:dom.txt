Conversation with Dominik

Combine hope with "workflow engine/semantics"
	- flowcharting as metaphor to put app together
	- ask what they're trying to do, build flowchart
		- zoom in to flowchart to screen
		- have field outline side by side with the actual layout

Datasources as items in the flowchart, drag in inputs, pull out fields/outputs

Processes as items in flowchart w/custom english glue
