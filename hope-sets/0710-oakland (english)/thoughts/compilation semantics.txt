Compilation/loading semantics
	- have a RESTey syntax for access
		http://site/hope/app/page/panel/etc
	- pages are actually served by a simple (PHP?) compilation engine
		- locate page asked for
		- check freshness date of source & compiled versions
		- if necessary compile (via browser? gears? php?)
		- compiled & zipped JS is served
		? compile templates in directly into page?
		? script scoping
		- part of compile is figuring out script dependencies
			- if 2 peers need same dependency, load at higher level (?)

	
	- loading order:
		- load hope (incl. template, etc)
		- load site logic and page stubs
		- figure out which page to load
		- load page
			? embed panels/etc?
		- load panels as necessary
