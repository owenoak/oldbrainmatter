These new phrases can be added to the site by hitting the "Add" button, and the new 
phrase will be added after whatever phrase was highlighted in the lower section. 
 
The pull downs for the top-down section are as follows: 
 
 
 
In the upper right portion of the user interface is a scrolling list that has all possible ECL 
commands enumerated (i.e. "set security for area", "set security for site", etc.).  The ECL 
commands which can have security set on them are as follows, with descriptions where 
appropriate. 
 
• set security for area 
• set security for site 
 These two commands give someone permission to set the security properties for 
an area or a site.  If someone is allowed to set the security, a form similar to the ones 
above is returned. 
• create weblets that override parent's settings 
This gives a user permission to create a weblet that can override the weblet's 
parent security, possibly allowing more permissive or restrictive use of the weblet 
then the parent would provide.  For example, using this setting would allow 
someone to create an editable Article weblet in an area where nothing can be 
edited. 
• assign all roles 
• assign Owner role 
• assign Editor role 
• assign Member role 
• assign Guest role 
These five commands gives a user the power to assign roles to other users in an 
area or a site.  For example, a user could be given the power to assign the Member 
role to a new user. 
• other (fill in command in box below) 
This selection is used for typing in ECL commands that have not been 
enumerated.  This is commonly used for setting ECL commands on individual 
weblets (i.e. edit "My Business Card"). 
• do everything with all weblets 
This gives a user free reign over all weblets in an area, though this does not give 
them permission to change a site or area's security settings or to assign roles. 
• edit all weblets 
• view all weblets 
• delete all weblets 
• clone all weblets 
These ECL commands give a user permission to run edit, view, delete, or clone commands on any 
weblet. 
• set security for all weblets 
This allows a user to change the security properties of a weblet; note that this does 
not include the ability to change the security permissions of the area or site. 
• create all weblets 
• create Business Card Weblet 
• create Normal Page Weblet 
• create Article Weblet 
• create Toolbar Weblet 
Every available weblet is enumerated and a 'create' option is put into the list.  This 
allows one to restrict the creation of certain types of weblets to certain users. 
• do everything with all Business Card Weblets 
• edit all Business Card Weblets 
• view all Business Card Weblets 
• delete all Business Card Weblets 
• clone all Business Card Weblets 
• move all Business Card Weblets 
• set security for all Business Card Weblets 
• do everything with all Normal Page Weblets 
• edit all Normal Page Weblets 
• view all Normal Page Weblets 
• delete all Normal Page Weblets 
• clone all Normal Page Weblets 
• move all Normal Page Weblets 
• set security for all Normal Page Weblets 
For each type of weblet all possible commands that can be run on this weblet is 
enumerated.  Above are two example enumerations for Business Card Weblets 
and Normal Page Weblets. 
 
The bottom portion of the security form shows all the security settings for the site.  Three 
buttons can be used to manipulate these: 'Remove', 'Save', 'Add', and 'Change'.  Hitting 
Remove removes a highlighted security setting from both the client and server.  Hitting 
Save saves a modified ECL command and all modifications.  Hitting Add causes the ECL 
command that has been specified in the top-portion of the user interface to be inserted 
into the bottom portion.  Hitting Change loads the selected ECL command into the top- 
portion. 
 
There is also a bottom section for assgning users different Roles for Sites.  The form to 
do this is located at the bottom of the Site form above.  The default role for all users can 
be set with this form.  Roles are listed in a list-box, and can be Removed, Saved, Added, 
and Changed by clicking on the appropriate buttons and selecting from the lower pull- 
downs (i.e. "Brad Neuberg" is an "Owner").
