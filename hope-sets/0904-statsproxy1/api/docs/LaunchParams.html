    <h2>Gear6 Memcached Launch Params</h2>

    <div class='indent'>
<pre>

The following launch parameters may be specified as part of the user data
option of ec2-run-instances or through the Amazon Web Services management
console.

When specifying parameters via the command line, use the -d option and 
enclose a space-separated list of key=value pair parameters within 
double quotes. For example:

  -d "password=none:,view:fnord,modify:plugh defaultAccess=view"


<b>allow-user-login=</b><i>y|n</i>

   By default, the Gear6 Memcached does not allow users to log into the system
   via ssh. By supplying this parameter with the value '<i>y</i>', the user
   will be able to log into the instance(s) using their standard EC2
   keypair (if provided at time of launch). 

   Note that users do not have root access to the instance and instead login
   using the username '<i>gear6-user</i>'.

   There are no password logins allowed with this (or any) user, only key
   based logins via ssh.

   To login, the customer should run the following (much like they would
   for an ordinary AWS login but with a different username):

       ssh -i &lt;private_key_path&gt; gear6-user@&lt;ip_address&gt;

   Default is <i>n</i> (no logins allowed).


<b>attach=</b><i>SERVICE_NAME</i>
<b>attach=</b><i>PRIVATE_IP/SERVICE_NAME</i>

   In the first form of this parameter, the default service name of the
   Gear6 Memcached instance is set to the provided string. This service name
   is used to identify instances meant to join a common memcache pool.
   However, when no IP address is provided (as in this first form) the
   launched instance(s) have no knowledge of other launched instances with
   the same service name and must be manually added to the pool using the
   Gear6 Memcached web-based management interface.

   When an IP address is provided prior to the service name (and separated
   with a forward slash '/'), the launched instance(s) will contact the
   existing instance at the IP address provided and attempt to join the
   existing memcache pool (of the same name) that instance already belongs to.

   Note:
      1. Service names cannot contain spaces, commas or forward slashes.
      2. When passing an IP address, the instance at that IP address must
         already be a member of a memcache pool (perhaps as its only member)
         with the same service name.


<b>dram-only=</b><i>y|n</i>

   Unlike traditional memcached servers, the Gear6 Memcached is capable of using
   block devices, such as the ephemeral storage devices provided within AWS. By
   default, the Gear6 Memcached will auto-configure itself based on the amount
   of DRAM and ephemeral storage available, and use the appropriate combination
   of the two to maximize available cache size. Typically, this results in a
   much larger available cache size than if one were to use exclusively DRAM.

   Unfortunately, due to the difference in access speeds of the underlying
   media, there can be a performance disadvantage to using both DRAM and
   ephemeral storage. If desired, the Gear6 Memcached can be forced to run
   using only DRAM by passing this parameter with the value '<i>y</i>'.

   Default is <i>n</i> (use both DRAM and ephemeral storage).

    
<b>defaultAccess=</b><i>ACCESS_LEVEL</i>

   Sets the default access level for the web management interface for the
   Gear6 Memcached instances launched. This will be the access level used when
   no user credentials have been supplied.

   Default is <i>none</i>. 


<b>password=</b><i>PASSWORD_STRING</i>

   Sets the password(s) for the different access levels for the Gear6 Memcached
   management interface. The password string contains a comma separated list of
   <i>Level:password</i> pairs. Passwords are entered in plaintext and should
   not contain either commas or double-quotes.
                 
   Defined access levels are:  <i>none</i>, <i>view</i>, <i>modify</i>.

   Example:    <i>password=none:,view:fnord,modify:plugh</i>
                            
   This will set no password for level none, "fnord" for level view, and "plugh"
   for modify.
